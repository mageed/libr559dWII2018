## 1.	Course Rationale & Goal: 

**Rationale/Background:** As social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube continue to play an important role in mediated communication today, be it at organizational or individual levels, the volume of data generated by their users increase phenomenally. Accordingly, searches and processing of social Web data beyond the limiting level of surface words are becoming increasingly important to business and governmental bodies, as well as to lay Web users. Detection of sentiment, emotion, deception, gender, sarcasm, age, perspective, topic, community, and personality are all valuable social meaning components that promise to be important elements of next generation search engines. The emerging area of extracting social meaning from social network data using automated methods is known as Social Media Intelligence (SMI). 

**Goal:** This course provides a graduate-level introduction to Social Media Intelligence (SMI) and its associated methods. The goal of the course is to create an interactive learning community around the theme of SMI. This includes familiarizing students with the types and uses of social media, and providing a basic level of hands-on experience in managing, analyzing, and mining social data using available tools (e.g., dashboards) and automated methods (e.g., natural language processing and machine learning technologies). We will read, discuss, and critique claims and findings from contemporary research related to SMI. We will also address practical issues related to successfully managing social media platforms, launching marketing campaigns, and using tools to analyze and mine social media. 

**Potential audiences for this course are:**

* People interested in text analytics, information retrieval, information visualization, human-information interaction, natural language processing, machine learning, etc., who want to prepare for, or significantly advance, carrying out research in these fields. 
* People interested in an introductory level of practical experience on effective usage, management, analytics, and mining of social media in work places (e.g., libraries, museums, companies).

## 2.	Course Objectives: 
Upon completion of this course students will be able to:

* Understand a wide range of social media usage, management, and mining concepts and tasks and their relevance to the information needs of diverse individuals, communities and organizations. [1.1]
* Enhance interpersonal and written communication skills. [2.1]
* Collaborate effectively with peers through course assignments. [3.1]
* Apply social media marketing, management, and mining methods to address information needs, questions, and issues. [4.1]
## 3.	Course Topics:
* Social media types and use and their role;
* Social media marketing and management;
* Social data crawling and engineering;
* Predictive analytics with natural language processing & machine learning;

## Notes on Assignments:


### ASSIGNMENT 1: *Social media in professional settings report* 

In this assignment, students will write a critical report focused at social media use in professional settings (e.g., government, corporate, educational organizations, libraries, museums). The report should discuss the most general cases of social media use in a number of chosen settings (3-4) and then focus more on a setting of the student choice. The report should be illustrated with real world examples of social media accounts. A rubric will be provided to walk students through the different steps. 

**Deliverables: *Social media in professional settings report (~ 1500 words)***

### ASSIGNMENT 2: *Analysis and evaluation of professional social media sources* 

For this assignment, students will work in groups of 3. Students will use a rubric that will be provided by the instructor as a basis for conducting a content analysis of 2-3 social media sources of their choice. The sources will each include one or more of the social media accounts of sources like libraries, museums, tech corporations, universities, or other organization. The rubric will guide stuents for analyzing the social media outlets of the sources (e.g., the Twitter account of the Vancouver Public Library https://twitter.com/VPL) in terms of, for example, frequency and time of postings, media used, interaction with users, topics of posts, network (e.g., which users are followed). Based on the analysis, students are expected to provide a critical evaluation of the extent to which each source/organization is successful in employing social media to reach its goal, including compared to similar organizations. As a result of the evaluation, students will include a section of recommendations to improve the performance of each source/organization.

**Deliverables: *A critical analysis and evaluation of a professional social media outlet (~ 2000 words)***

For this assignment, students are required to provide a written report with their analysis and evaluation. The evaluation should be supported by quantitative evidence as well as a qualitative appraisal of the performance of the source. Students should include a brief introduction, follow by the analysis and evaluation (students have the freedom to thematically organize the analysis and evaluation into different subsection, although the rubric will have recommended sections), a section on recommendations as described above, and a conclusion. Students are expected to follow norms of academic writing and document and support your claims by academic and professional references. Students are also encouraged to make use of Tables, figures, screenshots, and visualizations.

### ASSIGNMENT 3: *Term Project*

The purposes of this assignment include:
- Identifying, analyzing, assessing, and solving a problem via use of social media data;
- Applying social media intelligence methods to a practical task of your choice, after consultation with the instructor;
- Developing oral and written communication skills through discussions with classmates and instructor;
- Demonstrating ability to work as part of a team, including initiative taking, integrity, dependability and co-operation, and effective collaboration.

For this assignment, each student is required to work as part of a group of of 3\* on a project involving a practical task. Example projects include collecting Twitter data toward a specific topic and analyzes people’s views (pros and cons) around the topic (e.g., Syrian refugees, gun control, satisfaction with government performance on a given sector). This can be done via use of sentiment analysis, for example. Students can also choose problems for which a gender comparison is expected to yield interesting insights (e.g., gender differences as to affect, activities, topical interests, language styles, personality). For a third example, students can choose to extend ASSIGNMENT 2 by collecting more data from various sources and applying more extensive analyses. The final project should be demonstrably more in-depth and of a wider focus (both in terms of data and analysis) than the first two assignments.

* A group of a different size may be possible after consultation with the instructor.

**Deliverables** 
**Proposal (500-700 words)**
- Who are the the group members?
- What are you mining?
- What motivates your work? Why is it important or useful to undertake the chosen task?
- How does your project compare to other projects people have conducted in the past?
- What are the different steps you will take to ensure success of the project? What are the smaller segments of which the bigger task is composed? And how will you conduct each small task?
- How does the work bread down and what each member of the team be contributing?
- Timeline for completing the project, including goals for each segment.

**Final Report/Paper (3500-4000 words)** 
The final deliverable should include:
- A detailed and clear description of your project, including the necessary sections, as appropriate. For example, you will need to include an abstract, introduction, research questions, a literature review, a description of datasets, implementation details and methods employed, results, and a conclusion involving limitations and future directions;
- All data used, whenever possible;
- Pointers to a live version of the project, if any;
- As appropriate, you should situate your work within the wider context of previous works and approaches, with supporting arguments (~ 15 sources);
- Employment of figures, tables, and visualizations as appropriate to enhance argument and facilitate communicating your findings/results;

## 10. Course Policies

**Attendance:** The UBC calendar states: “Regular attendance is expected of students in all their classes (including lectures, laboratories, tutorials, seminars, etc.). Students who neglect their academic work and assignments may be excluded from the final examinations. Students who are unavoidably absent because of illness or disability should report to their instructors on return to classes.”

**Evaluation:** All assignments will be marked using the evaluative criteria given in this syllabus and also those provided on the SLAIS web site. 


**Access & Diversity:** Access & Diversity works with the University to create an inclusive living and learning environment in which all students can thrive. The University accommodates students with disabilities who have registered with the [Access and Diversity unit](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/access-diversity). You must register with the Disability Resource Centre to be granted special accommodations for any on-going conditions. 
**Religious Accommodation:** The University accommodates students whose religious obligations conflict with attendance, submitting assignments, or completing scheduled tests and examinations. Please let your instructor know in advance, preferably in the first week of class, if you will require any accommodation on these grounds. Students who plan to be absent for varsity athletics, family obligations, or other similar commitments, cannot assume they will be accommodated, and should discuss their commitments with the instructor before the course drop date. [UBC policy on Religious Holidays](http://www.universitycounsel.ubc.ca/policies/policy65.pdf).

## Academic Integrity
**Plagiarism**
The Faculty of Arts considers plagiarism to be the most serious academic offence that a student can commit. Regardless of whether or not it was committed intentionally, plagiarism has serious academic consequences and can result in expulsion from the university. Plagiarism involves the improper use of somebody else's words or ideas in one's work. 

It is your responsibility to make sure you fully understand what plagiarism is. Many students who think they understand plagiarism do in fact commit what UBC calls "reckless plagiarism." Below is an excerpt on reckless plagiarism from UBC Faculty of Arts' leaflet, [Plagiarism Avoided: Taking Responsibility for Your Work](http://www.arts.ubc.ca/arts-students/plagiarism-avoided.html).

"The bulk of plagiarism falls into this category. Reckless plagiarism is often the result of careless research, poor time management, and a lack of confidence in your own ability to think critically. Examples of reckless plagiarism include:

* Taking phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or statistical findings from a variety of sources and piecing them together into an essay (piecemeal plagiarism);
* Taking the words of another author and failing to note clearly that they are not your own. In other words, you have not put a direct quotation within quotation marks;
* Using statistical findings without acknowledging your source;
* Taking another author's idea, without your own critical analysis, and failing to acknowledge that this idea is not yours;
* Paraphrasing (i.e. rewording or rearranging words so that your work resembles, but does not copy, the original) without acknowledging your source;
* Using footnotes or material quoted in other sources as if they were the results of your own research; and
* Submitting a piece of work with inaccurate text references, sloppy footnotes, or incomplete source (bibliographic) information."

Bear in mind that this is only one example of the different forms of plagiarism. Before preparing for their written assignments, students are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with the following source on plagiarism: the [Academic Integrity Resource Centre](http://help.library.ubc.ca/researching/academic-integrity).

If after reading these materials you still are unsure about how to properly use sources in your work, please ask me for clarification. Students are held responsible for knowing and following all University regulations regarding academic dishonesty. If a student does not know how to properly cite a source or what constitutes proper use of a source it is the student's personal responsibility to obtain the needed information and to apply it within University guidelines and policies. If evidence of academic dishonesty is found in a course assignment, previously submitted work in this course may be reviewed for possible academic dishonesty and grades modified as appropriate. UBC policy requires that all suspected cases of academic dishonesty must be forwarded to the Dean for possible action.
